# dotfiles
Welcome to Patrick King's dotfiles repo.

There are a few things you should know about these dotfiles:
1) I use fish as my default shell, and you'll find the configuration under .config/fish/
2) My vim config is very opinionated. Only options listed under vim's ":options" command are in my .vimrc. The rest are located in the appropriate sub-directory under .vim/
3) There are large parts of my vimrc that require vim 8.0+, and in some cases, vim 8.1+.
4) Certain commands and key bindings might seem strange, but on top of my terminal I'm running Amethyst as window manager and Alfred as a launcher. All of the bindings are in place so everything plays nicely together.

I have always used DejaVu Sans Mono, but have recently switched to using [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/#home) DejaVu Sans Mono.
